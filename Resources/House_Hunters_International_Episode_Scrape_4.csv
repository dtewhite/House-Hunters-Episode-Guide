He's looking to set up shop and find a condo in the high-end beach district of Punta Cana, known for its white sand beaches and luxury hotels. Scott's main priority is location- he'd love to be able to walk to the beach. He's also looking for a two-bedroom place so he can have a separate office and more storage, and he'd like a pool on the premises. He's hoping his real estate expertise will help him find all of these amenities in a 200 thousand dollar budget. Real estate agent and friend Frances Pimentel is going to help Scott on his search for the right place. The first condo that Frances shows Scott is a one-bedroom, one and a half bath condo right on a golf course. It's listed for 195 thousand dollars and is 1100 square feet. Scott is impressed with the high end details and the luxurious pool area, but he's concerned about the lack of office space and that it's a bit further from the beach than he would like. Next up is a two-bedroom, two-bath condo selling for 180 thousand dollars that's only five minutes from the beach.

10,"Season 12, Episode 3",Finding a Home in Nicaragua,"Evan, who is from the Midwest, and Maria-Isabel who is from Nicaragua, own a restaurant together in historic Granada, Nicaragua. They are ready to buy a home but don't exactly agree on where. Evan wants to be as close to their restaurant in the city center as he can get, while Maria-Isabel is seeking a quieter, possibly more distant refuge. They both agree on size: 2 bedrooms plus an office, and on style: they like historic homes, and appreciate architectural authenticity. They also like to entertain and would like a hip space to do so. Real Estate Agent Sean Dennis shows them an historic home in the heart of town. Evan and Maria-Isabel love the home's authentic details and view of the cathedral, but Maria-Isabel is concerned about noise. Next Sean shows them a Colonial Reproduction a few minutes outside the center of town. Evan and Maria-Isabel are charmed by the fine finishes, courtyard pool, and rooftop deck, but they are disappointed in the home's lack of authenticity -- since it is a reproduction -- and worry about its ability to retain its value. Also, Maria-Isabel is still hoping for something more tranquil. Finally, Sean shows them a private island home on the lake. He explains that the lake is home to 365 ''isletas'' or private islands, and that this one could be their very own. The island home has a 2 bedroom home, and a 2 bedroom guest house, and beautiful natural landscaping. Evan and Maria-Isabel are wowed by the property, but concerned about the price, and the difficult commute (by boat). They weigh the pros and cons of each property, and ultimately choose the first house they saw - the authentic colonial in the heart of town.

She hopes to find a place in a small town or village where she can walk to shops and restaurants. With a budget of about $100,000, she knows it will still be a challenge. The first place her agent, Tony Hackett, shows her is a partially renovated home in Santa Dominica Talao. Listed for $85,000, this place has 2 bedrooms, 1 bath and is 1,183 square feet.

The next day Robert takes them to see a three bedroom, three bath 2100 square foot tri-level house in West End selling for 299 thousand dollars.

They're focusing their search on the Caribbean nation of the Dominican Republic because they love the beautiful blue waters, crystal clear skies, and affordable prices. The first condo that real estate agent Rico Pester takes them to has 2 bedrooms and 2 1/2 baths in 1720 square feet. It is in a development that is still under construction. Athos loves the breathtaking beachfront views, and Mary loves the in-unit laundry hook-ups. But the condo is priced at $417,000, which is $17,000 over their budget. The other disadvantage is that the development is a significant drive to town. The next place they see is a little closer in. It's a semi-attached villa that is reminiscent of the Greek architecture of Athos's youth. It has a private courtyard with pool and a spectacular rooftop deck. There are 3 bedrooms and 3 baths.

They have a budget of 100,000 Euro (equal to $140,000). They want a charming Italian cottage that has 2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, some outdoor space, and a working kitchen. The first place Dan and Andrea and their kids go to see with their agent, Nicola Di Girolamo, is at the top of a very windy road in the Abruzzo region. The home has 2 beds and 1 bath in 1300 sq. ft., and it's listed for the equivalent of $116,000. The exterior of the home is built with stone from the region, but the owners have drilled parts of the wall which has created huge cracks inside the living room. The kitchen is outdated and has very old appliances but at least the bedrooms are a good size and have a nice view. They like that it comes with 1.24 acres of land, but they aren't crazy about the windy road and how much work the home needs.

They like the idea that they could live in the small finished cottage while building a larger home on the site of the ruin.

Perry's job as an Airline baggage handler means he works outside during even the worst weather. After a trip to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, the couple decided to save up and buy a second home there. They want a 2 bedroom condo on a 2nd floor in a gated community that's close to the beach. But they have a very firm budget of $150,000 which means they may not be able to buy as close to the beach as they'd like. The first place their real estate agent Sabine Gruss takes them to see is a model unit in a large complex with a big pool. The complex is about 5 minutes walking from the beach. The unit has 1 bedroom and 1 and a half bathrooms in 1000 square feet. It's listed at $115,000 but upgrading to a second floor unit means the price would be closer to $120,000. They like the large patio and the updated kitchen but none of the furniture or appliances are included, so that would be an extra expense. They also want two bedrooms in case they have guests. The second place Sabine takes them to see is a condo in a smaller complex. It's about 10 minutes walking from the beach. The condo is on the second floor, and has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms in 1100 square feet. It's listed at the top of their price range, at $150,000. They like the small balcony but not the view of the countryside or the small pool in the complex. But Cheryl loves the updated kitchen and bathrooms, and having 2 bedrooms is a big plus. The third place they look at is actually a single family home. It's priced at $148,000 and has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms in 1500 square feet. The house itself is older and would need some work in the kitchen and bathrooms. And because it's larger they would have to buy more funriture to fill it up. But it's part of a community with an amazing pool and bar area that both cheryl and perry love. The only other drawback is that it is about a 10 minute drive from the beach.

Their real estate agent Bram Shook knows it might be difficult for them to find a place that's both close to the beach that also has ocean views, since in Nosara there is a wildlife refuge that separates all the homes from the beach. The first place he takes them to see is a 10 minute drive from the beach and has 3 bedrooms and 3 baths in 3000 square feet. It's listed for $525,000. The home has a nice pool and amazing ocean views, though Donna is worried about her grandson's safety since the patio has very little railing. They like all three bedrooms, but they aren't crazy about how far the home is from the beach. Later that same day Bram takes them to see a 3400 square foot, 4 bed, 3 bath home that's listed for $650,000. This home is a 10 minute walk to the beach, but it has a fantastic pool area with an outdoor bar and kitchen. They aren't crazy about the small guest rooms and the bright tropical paint colors but they do like the master bedroom and the ocean view from the rooftop deck.The next day Bram takes them to see a home that's a 2 minute walk from the beach. Listed for $450,000, the house has 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms in 1250 square feet. Ken and Donna like being closer to the beach but they aren't crazy about the inside of the home and the fact that there are no ocean views. They both think the furniture, countertops and appliances would need to be replaced, and the home is much smaller than the other two they saw. With one day left to make their decision, will Ken and Donna decide to buy or fly home empty handed?",https://www.hgtv.com/shows/house-hunters-international/episodes/south-carolina-retirees-buy-2nd-home-in-costa-rica
21,"Season 12, Episode 13",A Second Home in Ecuador,"Ever since Juan Moreno imigrated from Cuenca, Ecuador to the United States, he's dreamed of eventually owning a home there. He and his wife, Diane, recently retired to Orlando Florida and are now ready to make that dream a reality. They're going to buy a second home in Cuenca. They're bringing their daughter Anna along to help them on this search. With a budget of $120,000, they want to get a 4 bedroom, 2 bath home. They would like a traditional Spanish style home with a view, but still have the modern amenities they have now, such as an open floor plan, built for earthquakes. Their agent, Monica Rodas, takes them to a 4 bed, 1 1/2 bath, house in 2,798 square feet listed for $135,000. It's an older home with a hacienda style layout. While Diane and Juan like the large backyard and how the house reminds Juan of his childhood home, they're concerned that the house is not only above their budget but will need some serious updating. So, Monica takes them to a brand new townhouse listed at $105,000. This place has 4 beds, 3 1/2 baths and is 1,800 square feet. They love all of the modern amenities, such as the open upgraded kitchen, the size of the rooms and the third floor bonus room. But, they wish it had a nice yard like the first house and are concerned about the safety of the staircase to the bonus room. They also wish it had a little more character. Monica then takes them to a house listed for $85,000 in a developing neighborhood. This place has 4 bedrooms and 2 1/2 baths and is 2,000 square feet. They like the easy to maintain yard, kitchen pantry and some of the wood details. But, the bedrooms are a bit small and they can hear the construction noise in the neighborhood.

27,"Season 13, Episode 6","Heading to St. Croix, US Virgin Islands","Jeff and Tamara Katko love the life they've built for their family of four in comfortable Perrysburg, Ohio. There's only one thing missing; wintertime sunshine. For that, they're heading to the U.S. Virgin Islands in search of a vacation home that's sure to deliver. They'd like a two or three bedroom, two bathroom condo that's fully furnished, with a nice patio or deck, and that is within walking distance to a beach. If they could score an actual water view, they'd be delighted. Their budget is $350,000 - $450,000, which actually won't go a very long way in St. Croix, so this could be tough. Sales Associate Kerry Waldo is ready for the challenge. The first place she shows them is listed for $379,000. It has three bedrooms and two large decks, but is far from the beach. The second condo, listed at $460,000, is just steps from the sand, but only has two bedrooms, which means the Katko boys would have to share a room. The third condo also has just two bedrooms, and it's not close to the beach, but it's part of a lush golf course resort, and is listed for the more comfortable price of $350,000. What are Jeff and Tamara willing to compromise on? Walking distance to the beach? A third bedroom? Or price?
