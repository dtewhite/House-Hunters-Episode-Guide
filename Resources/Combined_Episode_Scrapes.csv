They are ready to buy a home but don't exactly agree on where. Evan wants to be as close to their restaurant in the city center as he can get, while Maria-Isabel is seeking a quieter, possibly more distant refuge. They both agree on size: 2 bedrooms plus an office, and on style: they like historic homes, and appreciate architectural authenticity. They also like to entertain and would like a hip space to do so. Real Estate Agent Sean Dennis shows them an historic home in the heart of town. Evan and Maria-Isabel love the home's authentic details and view of the cathedral, but Maria-Isabel is concerned about noise. Next Sean shows them a Colonial Reproduction a few minutes outside the center of town. Evan and Maria-Isabel are charmed by the fine finishes, courtyard pool, and rooftop deck, but they are disappointed in the home's lack of authenticity -- since it is a reproduction -- and worry about its ability to retain its value. Also, Maria-Isabel is still hoping for something more tranquil. Finally, Sean shows them a private island home on the lake. He explains that the lake is home to 365 ''isletas'' or private islands, and that this one could be their very own. The island home has a 2 bedroom home, and a 2 bedroom guest house, and beautiful natural landscaping. Evan and Maria-Isabel are wowed by the property, but concerned about the price, and the difficult commute (by boat). They weigh the pros and cons of each property, and ultimately choose the first house they saw - the authentic colonial in the heart of town.

The first condo that real estate agent Rico Pester takes them to has 2 bedrooms and 2 1/2 baths in 1720 square feet. It is in a development that is still under construction. Athos loves the breathtaking beachfront views, and Mary loves the in-unit laundry hook-ups. But the condo is priced at $417,000, which is $17,000 over their budget.

They have a budget of 100,000 Euro (equal to $140,000). They want a charming Italian cottage that has 2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, some outdoor space, and a working kitchen. The first place Dan and Andrea and their kids go to see with their agent, Nicola Di Girolamo, is at the top of a very windy road in the Abruzzo region. The home has 2 beds and 1 bath in 1300 sq. ft., and it's listed for the equivalent of $116,000. The exterior of the home is built with stone from the region, but the owners have drilled parts of the wall which has created huge cracks inside the living room.

Perry's job as an Airline baggage handler means he works outside during even the worst weather. After a trip to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, the couple decided to save up and buy a second home there. They want a 2 bedroom condo on a 2nd floor in a gated community that's close to the beach. But they have a very firm budget of $150,000 which means they may not be able to buy as close to the beach as they'd like.

The unit has 1 bedroom and 1 and a half bathrooms in 1000 square feet. It's listed at $115,000 but upgrading to a second floor unit means the price would be closer to $120,000. They like the large patio and the updated kitchen but none of the furniture or appliances are included, so that would be an extra expense. They also want two bedrooms in case they have guests.

The condo is on the second floor, and has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms in 1100 square feet. It's listed at the top of their price range, at $150,000.

The third place they look at is actually a single family home. It's priced at $148,000 and has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms in 1500 square feet. The house itself is older and would need some work in the kitchen and bathrooms. And because it's larger they would have to buy more funriture to fill it up. But it's part of a community with an amazing pool and bar area that both cheryl and perry love. The only other drawback is that it is about a 10 minute drive from the beach.

They're ready to buy a spacious home of their own on this historic Mediterranean island. They're open to remodeling, and their budget is $730,000 US. Real estate agent Frank Riela has learned to navigate the island's somewhat antiquated real estate practices, and believes he can help Jon and Reeva find the perfect home for their family and business.
